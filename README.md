Network Alarm Monitoring & Root Cause Analysis (RCA) System
Using Nagios → Kafka → Python

This project demonstrates a simplified network fault management system, where alarms generated by Nagios are transported through Kafka and analyzed by a Python-based Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Engine.

->> Project Overview
 1. Nagios Monitoring

Nagios monitors servers and services.
When an issue occurs (example: CPU high, disk full), Nagios triggers an event handler.

 2. Event Handler (Python)

The event handler collects alarm details and sends them to a Kafka topic named alarms.

 3. Kafka Message Broker

Kafka stores and forwards alarms as a message stream.

 4. RCA Engine (rca.py)

A Kafka consumer that:
Receives alarms
Removes duplicate alarms
Correlates events
Produces root cause outputs

 5. Alarm Simulator (nms_monitor.py) — Optional

If you don’t want to use Nagios, this script simulates SNMP-like alarms and sends them to Kafka.

🛠 Technologies Used
Component	Purpose
Nagios	Detects issues and sends alarms
Kafka	Message broker that stores and forwards alarms
Zookeeper	Required service for running Kafka
Python	Event handler, Kafka producer, and RCA engine
Docker	Runs Kafka environment
🧰 Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Start Docker Desktop

Ensure Docker Desktop is running.

2️⃣ Start Kafka & Zookeeper inside the container

If your Docker container is named kafka-nagios, run:

docker start kafka-nagios
docker exec -it kafka-nagios bash


Inside the container:

zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties &
kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties &

3️⃣ Install Python dependencies (on your Mac)
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

▶️ Run the RCA Engine

Open a new terminal (Mac):

python3 rca.py
python3 nms_monitor.py

Expected output format:

Listening for alarms...
Received Alarm: ALERT: Server1 Disk FULL
Root Cause: Disk issue detected.
